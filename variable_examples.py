#1) raise - used to raise an error. These errors are visible in the traceback and they cancel the execution of the program if not handled properly.
#2) elif- shorthand for else if, checks if some other condition holds when the condition in the statement is false. 
#3) while- this statement is used to start a while loop. It continues iteration until a condition is no longer True.
#4) lambda- A lambda function is an anonymous function. It can take any number of arguments but only have a single expression. 
#5) nonlocal - This keyword is used in functions inside functions to create anonymous functions.
